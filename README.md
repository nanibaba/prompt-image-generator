# Prompt Image Generator
Java machine learning AUBG Senior Project application 
generating an image from a prompt.

## Installation 

Usage of the software package requires the installation and setup of 
the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). 
Aditionally, the JRE must include Swing components. Usually, a standard 
installation of the JDK or JRE would suffice since Swing is commonly 
bundled in these packages. 

On Visual Studio Code,  opening the root folder would immeduiately 
prompt the installation the necessary Java extensions. In this case the 
"Debugger for Java" extension is needed. Once the extension is installed, 
VS Code will automatically ask for the installation of the JDK in case it does 
not exist on the user's system. 

Once the IDE is set up with all necessary Java extensions and the 
JDK and JRE are set up correctly, clicking on the "Run without debugging" 
button from the Prompter class file should launch the application. 

## Load time
Please expect a load time of around two 
minutes for the prompt window to pop up, as the program 
will first load the Word2vec model before opening the 
prompt window.

## Other editors 
A correct installation of the JDK and JRE should allow the program to run
on all IDEs supporting Java but VS Code is best suited for this setup, 
considering it automatically installs all required extensions.
